Here's a detailed description of what's visible in the image:

**Overall Scene:**

The image depicts a broken wooden table against a plain, white wall. The lighting is bright and appears to be coming from a frontal light source. The floor is a smooth, light grey concrete surface.

**The Table:**

*   **Type:** It appears to be a simple, rectangular wooden table.
*   **Condition:** The table is severely damaged and broken. 
*   **Structure:** The tabletop is intact, but one of the legs is completely detached and lying on the floor. The break looks relatively clean, suggesting a forceful snap rather than splintering.
*   **Material:** The table is made of light-colored wood, likely a softwood, with a visible grain pattern.
*   **Placement:** The table is positioned slightly angled towards the camera, with its corner nearest. 

**Broken Leg and Floor Pieces**

*  **Placement:** The detached leg is lying on the floor alongside two additional pieces of the table leg. 
*  **Material:** The wooden leg pieces, same as the rest of the furniture, is made of light-colored wood.

**Background:**

*   The wall is a smooth, matte white, providing a neutral backdrop that emphasizes the broken table.
*   There are no other noticeable objects or details in the background.



The composition creates a sense of disarray and highlights the fragility of the table.
